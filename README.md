# Theta-Paradox

> This is a mathematical paper that proves the existance of a theoretical paradox in one of the fundamental equations used in math and I believe that I discovered this paradox as I was unable to find a similar one in the internet or anywhere else. This paper was completely written by me and there were no online resources used to grab information from.
